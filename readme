This is the released repo for our work entitled `Pruning Adversarially Robust Neural Networks without Adversarial Examples`. 

** Environment **
pytorch-1.6.0
torchvision-0.7.0
numpy-1.16.1
scipy-1.3.1
tqdm-4.33.0
yaml-0.1.7

** Experiments **
One could produce the main results of Table 1, 2, 3, 4 & Figure 3, 4, 5 (KD+HBaR) by this repository. We will release the full version of the repository along with pre-tranined models soon.

To reproduce the HBaR experiments that we have in the paper, one could run our batch script by the following instruction:
    source env.sh
    mnist-KDHBaR.sh         # PK-HBaR on MNIST
    cifar10-KDHBaR.sh       # PK-HBaR on CIFAR-10
    cifar100-KDHBaR.sh      # PK-HBaR on CIFAR-100
